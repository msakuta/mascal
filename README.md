# rusty-parser

A self-learning project for making a new language using Rust and nom.

## Requirements

* rust 1.44

## Interpreter

Currently it only works as an iterpreter. It can read a text file, parser it to a
AST and run it.

## Ideas

I want to make it a complementary DSL for data manipulation, such as numpy.

* First-class array and matrix operations - from Matlab
* Statically typed array shapes - from Futhark
* Adapt to LLVM backend to make it a native compiler
